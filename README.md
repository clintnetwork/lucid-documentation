# About Lucid ·µè·µõ

## Introduction

Lucid is currently in a development stage but we want to achieve a fast, secure and distributed key-value store accessible through an HTTP API, we also want to propose persistence, encryption, WebSocket streaming, replication and a lot of features.

### Getting Started

Get the latest binary from the [releases](https://github.com/lucid-kv/lucid/releases) page and run these commands:

```text
$ ./lucid init
$ ./lucid --config lucid.yml server
```

Or run a node with Docker, but you need to create a [lucid.yml](https://github.com/lucid-kv/lucid/blob/master/.github/lucid.yml) file locally before.

```text
$ docker pull lucidkv/lucid
$ docker run -v lucid.yml:/etc/lucid/lucid.yml lucidkv/lucid
```

## Some Use Cases

* Private Keys Storing \(for a wallet by example\)
* IoT: collect and save statistics data
* A distributed cache for an application
* Service Discovery
* Distributed Configuration
* Blob Storage
