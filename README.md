# About Lucid ·µè·µõ

### Introduction

Lucid is currently in an embryonic state. We hope to achieve a fast, secure and distributed key-value store accessible through an HTTP API. We also want to offer persistence, encryption, WebSocket streaming, replication and a lot of other features.

### Works Progress
